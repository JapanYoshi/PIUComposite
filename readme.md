#Description
Pump It Up Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](stepf2.blogspot.com). Its goal is to provide an expansion to the song list without deviating too much from the official charting styles. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided.

#Background Videos
Due to large file sizes, background videos are only [available separately](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/o65fzhtvonpv9g6,u0k1ioy2w5kiudx/shared).

#Installation instructions
* Click on “Clone or download”, then click on “Download ZIP" (unless you want to do some fancy keeping-up-to-date using Git).
* Extract the .zip file onto StepF2\Songs\Composite.
(Make sure that you create a new folder first, or everything will spill out into the Songs folder!)
* Run StepF2.
* If the new songs aren't showing up, go to Options and reload all songs.
