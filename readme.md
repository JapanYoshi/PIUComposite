# Description

![Pump It Up Composite 2019 Logo](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/PIUComposite/raw/master/logo.png)

Pump It Up Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](stepf2.blogspot.com). Its goal is to provide an expansion to the song list without deviating too much from the official charting styles. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided.

## Background Videos
