# Description

![PIUComposite Logo](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/PIUComposite/raw/master/logo.png)

Pump It Up Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](stepf2.blogspot.com). Its goal is to provide an expansion to the song list without deviating too much from the official charting styles. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided.

## Background Videos

Due to large file sizes, background videos are only [available separately on MediaFire.](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/o65fzhtvonpv9g6,u0k1ioy2w5kiudx/shared).

## Noteskins

Pump It Up Composite also has complementary noteskins. (Download coming soon)

# Public Beta

Pump It Up Composite is in **Public Beta.** Consider joining [the official Discord server](https://invite.gg/piu) or, if there is an issue, posting an issue to this repository.
