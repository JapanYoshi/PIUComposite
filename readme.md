# Description

![Pump It Up Composite 2019 Logo](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/PIUComposite/raw/master/logo.png)

Pump It Up Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](stepf2.blogspot.com). Its goal is to provide an expansion to the song list without deviating too much from the official charting styles. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided.

## Background Videos

Due to large file sizes, background videos are only [available separately on MediaFire.](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/97il513n5iaxn/Pump_It_Up_Composite).

For the same reason, the archive is split into parts 1GB each. Download them all and open the file numbered .001 using 7zip or another extractor that supports multipart .7z files.

## Noteskins

Pump It Up Composite also has its own noteskin! [See a list of all noteskins here.](http://fizzystack.web.fc2.com/stepmania/noteskins.html)
